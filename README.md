# Techdegree Project 1
Random Quote Generator

This project takes an array of movie or TV show quotes (along with a couple comic strip quotes) and randomly displays them either on user demand or via an auto refresh function.  

The goal for me was to get the most out of the programming experience by "exceeding expectations" rather than shoot for any particular grade.  The challenge of researching and thinking through the various problems was highly rewarding.
